# nosql-challenge

Cloned repository and added starter files downloaded from Bootcamp Spot.
Ran the Terminal code from the Root Repo folder - can run staright from main folder (no need to navigate to Resource folder to use terminal)
Reviewed all code against marking criteria to ensure code matches what is asked.
Commiting and Pushing all documents to repository now that i've finished working on files locally.


~Working Notes~
tested code on both starter files - seems to work fine.

--An update_many() query is performed to convert the latitude and longitude fields from strings to decimal numbers (4 points)--
Initially converted using toDecimal - however this is a seperate pymongo datatype - changed to toDouble and checked outputs and can confirm results converted to decimal from string (output no longer showing '' around decimal)
